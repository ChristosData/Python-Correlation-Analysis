# Python-Correlation-Analysis
Using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib we conduct some correlation analysis and visualise some data points

The following skills were utilised:<br>
- Data cleaning<br>
- Converting data types<br>
- Checking for duplicates<br>
- Plotting a scatter plot<br>
- Plotting a linear regression model<br>
- Calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between variables, presenting it in a correlation matrix <br>
- Visualising the correlation matrix in a heatmap<br>
- Converting cells with an object type to a number, to then compare those variables in a correlation matrix<br>
- Pivotting a level of the hierarchical index labels, sorting the pairs to see values of interest<br>
