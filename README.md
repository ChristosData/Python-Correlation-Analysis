Using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib we conduct some correlation analysis and visualise some data points


Data cleaning
Converting data types
Checking for duplicates
Plot a scatter plot
Plot a linear regression model
Calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between variables, present it in a correlation matrix 
Visualise the correlation matrix in a heatmap
Converting cells with an object type to a number, to then compare those variables in a correlation matrix
Pivot a level of the hierarchical index labels, sorting the pairs to see values of interest
